            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I am a passionate full stack developer experienced in Javascript, Typescript, HTML, and CSS; although I am a polyglot of programming languages.</p>
            <p>I am currently a student at Western Governors University.</p>
            <p>Before college I served in the United Stated Army in various positions within the infantry where I learned to 
                lead others, work as a team, and developed a task oriented mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am now looking to begin the next chapter in my life as a full stack web developer because of my passion for
                the web and the limitless frontier it presents. I find it deeply rewarding to see my websites come to life and
                create a positive user experience.
            </p>
            <h3>My Skills</h3>
            <p>Below is a list of my skills and technologies I am familiar with. My current focus is on full stack web development,
                but in the past I wrote multiple compilers and interpreters in C++ and Rust. I am also well versed in Linux
                and have used it as my workstation OS for most of my computing life.
