            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Liam Eckert. I am a passionate developer with a growing interest in full-stack development. 
                I began programming in elementary school, hacking around with Python.
                 My early experiments quickly led me to Linux as well as an interest in programming language design. 
            </p>
            <p>
                In high school, I began to understand how to implement scripting languages, and compilers through self-study.
                 After graduation, I enlisted in the United States Army where I served in the Infantry and learned how to work as a team, embrace hardship, and lead a team. 
                 I am now pursuing my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at Western Governors University. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I am interested in full-stack development because the web is the frontier of all technology. 
                I believe I am a great fit for a job as a web developer because of my deep understanding of how Javascript, Typescript, and similar languages work under the hood, enabling me to write optimized code as well as learn new languages quickly. 
            </p>
