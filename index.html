            <p>
              File box is an anonymous file storage and retrieval service. When a user submits file,
              it is compressed on the frontend, passed to the backend, and in return the user receives a
              64 character retrieval key that they can enter to get their file back at anytime. This key
              can be shared with others or kept private. File box allows for efficient and secure sharing and
              storage of files.

            <p>
              Microblog is a simple microblog web app. Users can post, like and comment on posts. The backend is written in TypeScript using 
              Express.js, Zod, and Prisma. The frontend is written using TypeScript, React, and Bootstrap. The app uses a SQLite database. 
              It is a work in progress, that I expect to continue working and improving on until I am ready to host it online.

            <p>
              Clox is my implementation of the Lox programming language from the book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html">Crafting Interpreters</a> by Robert Nystrom. 
              The book is a great resource for learning about interpreters and compilers. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning more about how programming languages work.
              After I am finished implementing this version of Lox in C I plan to port it to Rust and write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JIT Compiler</a> for it
              using LLVM.
