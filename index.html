          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>
            I am a software engineer with a deep passion for systems level programming. I began my journey when I was 14
            years old learning python, I soon taught myself C, C++, as well as Rust. Somewhere in high school I became interested in
            compiler engineering and ever since I have had the hobby of designing and implementing my own programming
            languages.
          </p>
          <p>
            After high school I volunteered to serve in the United States Army as an infantryman. I served with the 25th
            Infantry Division in Hawaii and reached the rank of Specialist in a competitive unit. Due to an injury
            sustained in training I was medically discharged from the Army and given the opportunity to pursue my passion for
            software engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am now pursuing my B.S. in Computer Science at Western Governors University. I look forward to graduating
            and seeing what the future holds for me in the field of software engineering. I am always looking for new
            opportunities to learn and grow as a software engineer.

          <h3>B.S. in Computer Science, Western Governors University, December 2022 - December 2024</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently pursuing my B.S in Computer Science at WGU. My studies have been focuses around
            C/C++, Python, and Java. I have also studied discrete mathematics, data structures, algorithms,
            computer architecture, and artificial intelligence. I enjoy the opportunity to learn new things in
            a self paced environment that has enabled me to work quickly through my studies.
