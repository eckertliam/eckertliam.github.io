I'm Liam Eckert, a software engineer with a sharp focus on compilers, low-level systems, and machine learning for program optimization. I care about performance, correctness, and elegant abstractionsâ€”and I build tools that make code smarter and faster.

My background includes military service, a Computer Science degree, and real-world experience building programming languages, optimizing compilers, and analyzing LLVM IR with machine learning. I'm especially interested in the application of machine learning to compiler optimizationâ€”using data-driven methods to guide decisions like inlining, register allocation, and transformation ordering.

When I write here, it's usually about programming language theory, compiler internals, or system-level problem solving. Occasionally, I branch into experimental tooling, performance metrics, or weird edge cases I've reverse engineered for fun.

If you're building systems that run deep, fast, or bothâ€”Iâ€™d love to talk.
